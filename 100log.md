I have for a long time wanted to become a better coder but never could "make the time" to pursue it. I have committed to the 100 days of code challenge. For the next 100 days I will spend at least one hour day coding, with an emphasis on Python, Powershell, Bash, and maybe even some C. These skills will help me push towards an offensive security position. 

### Day 0: November 14, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy Lessons

**Thoughts:** Python would be a great tool to help with my pentesting career. I am starting my 100 days of code challenge in order to force myself to get better with Python.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
