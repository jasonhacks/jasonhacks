I have for a long time wanted to become a better coder but never could "make the time" to pursue it. I have committed to the 100 days of code challenge. For the next 100 days I will spend at least one hour day coding, with an emphasis on Python, Powershell, Bash, and maybe even some C. These skills will help me push towards an offensive security position. 

### Day 5: December 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: A Job Application! Today I applied for a company and one of the tests was to write a simple Python script. 

**Thoughts:** I admit ... this took me a little longer than it should have. I had never used sorting via lamda before. (Full disclosure I still don't fully understand it.) [SortIP.py Link](https://github.com/jasonhacks/NoobPython/blob/master/SortIP.py)

### Day 4: December 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy Python Courses - Continuing down the same path.

**Thoughts:** For some reason I am having a problem wrapping my head around using dictionaries properly, especially when it came to combining the two. Like if one had a quantity and one had a price how do you pair the keys to get a total. Hopefully I get the hang of it tomorrow. 

### Day 3: December 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy Python Courses - Successfully wrote a dice roller bot where you guess the rolls. Just a few definitions and a couple if/then statements. [RollDice.py Link](https://github.com/jasonhacks/NoobPython/blob/master/RollDice.py)

**Thoughts:** It was kinda neat to see my stupid simple Python program come together. I really should find some other simple stuff like that to do just to get my brain flexing what it has learned. I started looking at other Python programs written using Paramiko and surprisingly I can follow quite a bit of it. Might try to move some code around between projects and see if I can build something of my own. 

### Day 2: December 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More Code Academy Python Course and reading about Paramiko.

**Thoughts:** I spend a good amount of time logging into clusters of servers and pulling logs by hand. Using Paramiko I can write a script that logs in, pulls the data I need, and then I can filter down to grab what I need quickly and easily. I am thinking this will be a good idea for my first project. 

### Day 1: December 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy Python Course. Basics + Condition and Control Statements.

**Thoughts:** Python is where I am starting first. The world says it is easy to get going and some of my OSCP activities require it, so here we are. I have done a lot of these basics before when I tried to learn in the past so it is coming back to me quickly.

### Day 0: November 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the blog, deciding what path I want to take. 

**Thoughts:** Python, Powershell, and Bash are key when attempting to automate repetitive tasks. Spending time learning these skills now will undoubtedly pay for itself tenfold once I begin automating tasks that I frequently perform.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
